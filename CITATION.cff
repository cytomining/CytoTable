    title: Colas Lab Example IN Carta Dataset
    type: data
    notes: >-
      The Colas Lab provided access to a single-cell dataset exported from
      IN Carta Image Analysis Software (Molecular Devices) for
      use within CytoTable tests for furthering development efforts.
      A modified testing dataset appears within this project
      under `tests/data/in-carta/colas-lab`.
