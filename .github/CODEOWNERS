# CODEOWNERS file
# This file is used to define individuals or teams
# that are responsible for code in a repository.
# When PR's are opened, these individuals will be
# added as reviewers automatically (except if they
# are authors of the work). Each line is a file
# pattern followed by one or more owners.
# For more information, see:
